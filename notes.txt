-pygame.init()
--this calls the init function of all the seperate modules of pygame.

-<surface>.blit(surf, location)
--transfers from one surface to another
--the location can be a tuple or you can pass the surf.get_rect() and it will use the position of the rect

-pygame.display.flip()
--displays what has been drawn since the last flip

-pygame custom events
--pygame defines events internally as integers, so you need to define a new event with a unique integer. The last event pygame reserves is called USEREVENT, so defining ADDENEMY = pygame.USEREVENT + 1 on line 83 ensures itâ€™s unique.
